Tito Cecil's Project Notes.

Important equations to consider:
- Force = Mass * Acceleration
- Acceleration = Velocity / Time
- (Rewriting) Force = Mass * Velocity / Time
- (Rewriting) Force * Time / Mass = Velocity

Swimming Speed has been defined as (per multiple sources):
- Speed = PropulsiveForce * TurnoverRate - Drag

Where Propuslive Force is defined as the force created with
the movements of the swimmer's arms and legs. So far I have
not found anything on calculating Turnover Rate or Drag. 
Therefore for the purposes of this project or until more
notes are found, we will consider Swimming Speed as the 
following:
- Speed = PropulsiveForce

----------------------PROPOSITION------------------------
Now since Propulsive Force will be measured in Newtons, I
propose that we use the equations above to calculate an
associated velocity with Force. In order for the velocity
to be accurate, time will play a factor. Perhaps we can
measure and update the speed of the swimmer every 2-3 
seconds so time can equal 3 in the equation. Then to measure
force, an average should be taken from as many readings 
from the strain gauge as possible. The average will give
the system a good idea of how much force the swimmer is
exerting. Mass will also be needed for to calculate velocity.

----------------------PROBLEMS-------------------------
- The problem with using this formula is velocity will be
meausred in N*s/kg NOT m/s. Because distance is not a
factor in the equation, we cannot convert to meters. This
however will be the most scientifically accurate method.
(FIXED: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton-second)
According to multiple sources the following equation may
be used to convert velocity:
- N * s = kg * m /s
- (Rewritten) N * s / kg = m / s
With this we can now accurately collect the velocity in
meters per second.

- Another problem exists in the method of measuring the
propulsion force. Technically, the force used in the
swimming speed is exerted from the arms and legs. While 
using the belt and a strain gauge to measure the force isnt
a bad idea, the problem is that you are incorporating 
other variables that might affect the actual force being
exerted from the arms and legs. In short, the force being
measured from the belt strain gauge might not be the exact
propulsion force.
