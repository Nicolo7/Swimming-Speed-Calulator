# Swimming-Speed-Calulator
Using a load cell and the HX711, I want to calculate force being produced by swimmer and translate it into some velocity. This is based off the physics principle that Force = Mass * Acceleration. If force can be calculated, and mass is given by the weight of the swimmer, then the acceleration contains the velocity of the swimmer at the given instance. Other forces and variables are still at play, but starting off with that simple truth and further expanding on it will allow me to get closer to what I want. Any comments or suggestions is appreciated, this is also my first project on GitHub.
